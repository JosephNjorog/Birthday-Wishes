## Getting Started

cd happy-birthday-party
```

### 2. Installing Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

### 3. Customizing the Greeting

To make this birthday greeting truly special, you'll want to customize a few things. Here's how you can do it:

#### **Editing the Message**

Open `index.html` and locate the following section:

```html
<p class="idea-1" data-node-name="text2">That's what I was going to do.</p>
<p class="idea-2" data-node-name="text3">But then I stopped.</p>
<p class="idea-3">
  <span data-node-name="text4">I realized, I wanted to do something</span>
  <strong data-node-name="text4Adjective">special</strong>.
</p>
<p class="idea-4" data-node-name="text5Entry">Because,</p>
<p class="idea-5">
  <span data-node-name="text5Content">You are Special</span>
  <span class="smiley" data-node-name="smiley">:)</span>
</p>
```

Feel free to replace these lines with your own personalized messages. Whether you want to express heartfelt sentiments or add a dash of humor, make it yours!

#### **Customizing the Audio**

To change the audio file for the birthday song, replace the `Simi Happy Birthday Ft Adekunle Gold Deja Lyrics.mp3` file in `src/audio/` with your preferred audio file. Make sure to name it the same as the existing file, or update the `index.html` file to reflect the new file name.

#### **Changing Images**

Replace the images in the `img/` folder with your own. For example, if you want a different background or a new hat, just update `Love21.png` or `hat.svg` with your own files. Ensure the new images have the same names or adjust the HTML accordingly.

#### **Styling Adjustments**

To tweak the appearance of your birthday greeting, edit `style/style.css`. This is where you can play around with colors, fonts, and layouts to fit your theme.

## Running the Project

To view your customized birthday greeting, simply open `index.html` in your web browser. For a more advanced setup, you can use a local server like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):

```bash
npx http-server
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to see your creation in action!
